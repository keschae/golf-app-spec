# Feature Specification: MCSGA Golf Portal (Next.js Stack)

**Feature Branch**: `002-nextjs-golf-portal`  
**Created**: 2026-01-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Stack**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Tailwind CSS + Prisma

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  User stories are PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey is INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE.
  
  Priority Definitions:
  - P1 (MVP Core): Member authentication, course/event management, event viewing, profile, team management, tee time requests
  - P2: Captain score entry, full CRUD for administrators
  - P3: Team score reports
  
  NOTE: User stories are identical to Laravel spec - only implementation differs
-->

### User Story 1 - Member Authentication (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

As a member, I want to log in to the portal using my email and password so that I can access member-only features.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation for all role-based features. Without it, no other functionality can be accessed securely.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting login with valid/invalid credentials and verifying session creation and role-based redirects.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered member with email "john@example.com", **When** they enter correct email and shared password, **Then** they are logged in and redirected to the dashboard
2. **Given** a team captain with email "captain@example.com", **When** they enter correct email and individual password, **Then** they are logged in with captain privileges visible
3. **Given** an administrator with email "admin@mcsga.org", **When** they enter correct credentials, **Then** they are logged in with full admin menu visible
4. **Given** any user, **When** they enter incorrect credentials, **Then** they see an error message and remain on login page
5. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they click logout, **Then** their session is destroyed and they are redirected to login

---

### User Story 2 - View Upcoming Events (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

As a member, I want to see upcoming golf events on my dashboard so that I know when and where the next outings are scheduled.

**Why this priority**: Event visibility is the core value proposition of the portal - members need to know about upcoming events.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as any member and verifying event cards display with correct information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in member, **When** they view the dashboard, **Then** they see a list of upcoming events with name, date, and course
2. **Given** an event with an assigned tee time for the member's team, **When** viewing the event card, **Then** the assigned tee time is displayed
3. **Given** an event without an assigned tee time, **When** viewing the event card, **Then** "TBD" is shown for tee time

---

### User Story 3 - View Course Details (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

As a member, I want to view detailed information about a golf course so that I can prepare for the event.

4. **Given** a scoring report, **When** viewing, **Then** it shows total participants and average score

---

### User Story 19 - Teams and Members Report (Priority: P3)

As an administrator, I want to view a report of all teams and their members so that I can see the organization structure.

**Why this priority**: Organizational reports are useful but not MVP-critical.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating the report and verifying all teams/members display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an administrator, **When** they generate the Teams and Members report, **Then** all teams are listed
2. **Given** the report, **When** viewing a team, **Then** all members are shown with captain designation
3. **Given** the report, **When** viewing a member, **Then** their primary team is indicated

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a member belongs to multiple teams? → They can view all teams but have one primary team
- What happens when a captain is removed from a team? → They lose captain privileges for that team only
- What happens when an event is cancelled? → Status changes, event hidden from dashboard, tee times cancelled
- What happens when a course is deleted that has events? → Deletion should be prevented or cascade handled
- What happens with concurrent score entry? → Optimistic locking with conflict resolution
- What happens if shared password is changed while members are logged in? → JWT tokens remain valid until expiry

## Next.js-Specific Implementation Notes

### Authentication Strategy

```typescript
// Use NextAuth.js with credentials provider
// Custom logic for shared password vs individual password

// lib/auth.ts
import { NextAuthOptions } from "next-auth";
import CredentialsProvider from "next-auth/providers/credentials";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";
import bcrypt from "bcryptjs";

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: "credentials",
      credentials: {
        email: { label: "Email", type: "email" },
        password: { label: "Password", type: "password" }
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        // 1. Find member by email
        // 2. Check if member has individual password
        // 3. If yes, validate against individual password
        // 4. If no, validate against shared password from system_settings
        // 5. Return user with role information
      }
    })
  ],
  callbacks: {
    async jwt({ token, user }) {
      // Add role and team info to JWT
    },
    async session({ session, token }) {
      // Add role and team info to session
    }
  }
};
```

### Type Safety Example

```typescript
// types/index.ts
import { z } from "zod";

export const memberSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  firstName: z.string().min(1),
  lastName: z.string().min(1),
  phone: z.string().optional(),
  isAdmin: z.boolean().default(false),
  primaryTeamId: z.number().optional(),
});

### React Query Integration

```typescript
// hooks/use-events.ts
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export function useEvents() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["events"],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const res = await fetch("/api/events");
      return res.json();
    },
  });
}

export function useCreateEvent() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (data: EventInput) => {
      const res = await fetch("/api/events", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify(data),
      });
      return res.json();
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["events"] });
    },
  });
}
```
